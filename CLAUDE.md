# Cabinet planner

Public, lead-generation cabinet planner for **EzCabinet Sdn Bhd** (Malaysian cabinet manufacturer). Built by JNS Nexion Enterprise.

An end customer picks a room, arranges cabinets along one wall in 3D, sees a price, and submits a quote request. EzCabinet's sales team receives the lead with a rendered image attached.

**This is a marketing surface, not a production tool.** It must be convincing and fast on mid-range Android in Malaysia. It does not need to be manufacturing-accurate. A human validates every design before it becomes a real order.

Reference product: IKEA's PAX planner. Not the full IKEA room planner — one room, one wall.

## History worth knowing

The first build was a **wardrobe** configurator: a five-step stepper that split one opening into bays, at `/viewer`, on an engine in `lib/wardrobe`. It was superseded by the room planner in August 2026 and deleted (commit `5b2f0e7`). If you find a doc, comment, or branch referring to `/viewer`, `lib/wardrobe`, `components/configurator`, bays, or the `WARDROBE` product — that is the old design. Do not rebuild it. `git show 5b2f0e7^` has it if you need to read it.

The wardrobe survives only as a seed family (`id: "wardrobe"`) in `lib/planner/catalogue.ts`, which tests use as a fixture.

## Status

Phase 0 (catalogue + pricing spec with client) not yet complete — see Open questions. The engine, the planner UI, and the admin catalogue surface are built. `/admin/cabinet-designs` is the one catalogue screen: each uploaded design is one cabinet, filed under the rooms that offer it, and `POST /api/admin/cabinet-designs/publish` rebuilds the catalogue from the design rows (`lib/catalogue/buildCatalogue.ts`). Customers can check out: `POST /api/orders` re-validates and re-prices the design and stores an `Order` (manual bank transfer until a gateway is chosen), `/admin/orders` marks it paid, and **Create delivery** opens the logistics form pre-filled from the design (`lib/orders`). Opted-in customers get WhatsApp updates for the order, each admin-advanced production stage and the delivery (`lib/whatsapp`, Meta Cloud API); go-live waits on EzCabinet — see Open questions. Share links are the remaining Phase 3 work.

**Confirmed client requirement (resolved):** EzCabinet designs in SketchUp and asked for "upload SketchUp designs so we can maintain new configurations." It is resolved the literal way: the planner **renders the model they drew** — see [3D](#3d). This reversed an earlier decision to rebuild each cabinet procedurally from extracted numbers; that section carries the measurements that changed it.

**The file format is OBJ, not `.skp`, everywhere.** A `.skp` is a SketchUp-proprietary container that in practice needs SketchUp itself to read; the `openskp` reader was deleted in August 2026 along with `lib/skp`. The client exports the design folder as Wavefront OBJ — `.obj` + `.mtl` + textures — and uploads it zipped. `lib/mesh` reads it. Nothing in the app accepts a `.skp` any more: not catalogue import, not the cabinet-design library. If you are adding an upload that takes a design, it takes `.obj`/`.zip`.

## Stack

The dependency list is `package.json`. The two that need saying:

- Mux for the DIY tutorial videos — the one thing in the app that is streamed rather than generated
- Deployed on Vercel, functions pinned to `sin1` (Singapore) — users are in Klang Valley

## Architecture

### The core rule: the layout document is the single source of truth

A design is a set of cabinets placed in rows against one wall. Each placed cabinet references a **family** — one uploaded design — and its width. Everything else — 3D geometry, price, quote, and eventually the cutting list — is **derived** from that JSON. Nothing is stored twice.

```
Room document (JSON) — RoomLayout, src/lib/planner/room.ts
  ├─ roomId:     kitchen | living | bedroom | foyer
  ├─ plan:       { template: rect | l, widthMm, depthMm, notch…, mirror }   lib/planner/floorplan.ts
  ├─ ceilingHeightMm, hangingHeightMm, …   shared settings
  ├─ runs[]:     one per wall of the plan; each { floor[], wall[] }
  │                modules: familyId, widthMm, xMm, doorStyleId
  ├─ corners[]:  { vertex, floor, wall } — corner units, inside corners only
  └─ free[]:     free-standing cabinets — centre + yaw, never against a wall
```

### One design, one cabinet

The customer does not drag a slider or step through a size ladder. EzCabinet draws **one export per width** — BC 600, BC 800, BC 900 — and each export is its own cabinet: its own name, all-in price (door included), box and drawn model. A catalogue family is exactly one design with exactly one size, and its id is the design's id. This is deliberate:

- It matches how EzCabinet manufactures — standard modules, each a SKU.
- It is what makes rendering the drafted model 1:1 possible: every cabinet has a real file behind it.
- The price a customer sees is the one the admin typed, and the Phase 4 SKU list falls straight out of the layout.

An earlier design grouped the widths into one family with a ladder, matched by shape. On the client's first uploads it folded BC 600 / 800 / 900 into the seed's invented `base-cabinet`, kept that family's invented prices and box, and no screen could tell which cabinet was real. Do not bring the ladder back.

`familySchema.sizes` is still an array and `layout.ts` still places against it, so a multi-width family (the seed, older published versions) still works; the resize control only shows when a family has more than one size. The add-cabinet menu groups cabinets by the design library's category.

### Room shapes

A room is a **floor plan** (`plan: FloorPlan`, `lib/planner/floorplan.ts`) —
a template with editable wall lengths, not a wall list. `rect` has four walls,
`l` has six (a notch cut from one front corner, mirrorable); a U template is
one more shape later. Every corner is 90° and closure is guaranteed by
construction: there is no wall list to leave open. `wallsOf(plan)` derives the
walls (start, end, length, yaw, inward normal) and `setWallLength(plan, wall,
mm)` edits one, clamped only to the plan's own limits (`clampPlan`). The
cabinet-aware clamp is the engine's `setWallLength` (`room.ts`): a wall never
goes shorter than what its cabinets, corner squares and any free cabinet need —
it bisects to the nearest length `isClear` accepts.

A room is still **runs** — `runs[i]` belongs to wall *i*. Each run is still the
one-dimensional thing `layout.ts` places: `runView` hands a run to that engine
as an ordinary `PlannerLayout`, with an active corner as a `reserved` span, and
`withRun` writes its rows back. No placement rule knows about corners — a
corner is one more neighbour in `occupiedSpans`.

**Winding rule (load-bearing).** Facing any wall from inside the room, its
start is on the left, so every inside vertex is the **left-hand corner of the
wall after it**. A corner unit is drawn for the left-hand corner and is never
turned or mirrored to fit — it always sits at the start of the wall it
belongs to. This is also why a migrated v2 run keeps its `xMm`: v2 already
placed left to right facing the wall from inside.

A vertex is an **active corner** when both walls meeting there hold cabinets,
or the vertex holds a corner unit (`CORNER_BASE_CABINET` / `CORNER_WALL_CABINET`,
`isCorner`) — never stored, always derived. Adding the first cabinet to a
wall's neighbour activates its shared corner and runs `cascadeCorner` to slide
cabinets clear; the edit is refused if a wall has no room. An active corner
reserves 607 mm (floor) / 397 mm (wall) empty, or the unit's width once one is
placed, on **both** walls. Removing the last cabinet from either wall frees the
square; nothing is pulled back toward it. An **outside corner** (the L notch's
inner corner) never holds a unit and never reserves anything — a run ending
there has an open end.

Every room now has walls all round, so a cabinet flush against a side wall
(within one board) wears no end panel — see Open questions. Stored orders are
design v3; v1 and v2 are migrated to v3 on read as a `rect` plan — v2 never had
an L-shaped *room*, only an L-shaped kitchen run along two walls of a
rectangle. The straight run lands on wall 0; a v2 L's side run lands on wall 3
(left) or wall 1 (right), and its corner unit at the vertex those walls share
(3 or 0), so the kitchen the customer built is unchanged, only the room around
it is now explicit.

### Wall numbering

Once a room has more than one wall, "which wall" needs a name a customer and
the admin both use. The Room panel shows a small floor-plan map (`WallMap`,
`RoomPanel.tsx`) with every wall numbered in a matching badge, and each wall's
length field carries the same number. The scene mirrors it: `showWallNumbers`
turns on floor badges at the foot of every wall while the Room panel is open —
off by default, since they're clutter once the shape is settled — and plan
view labels each wall "Wall n" beside an editable length chip
(`WallLengths.tsx`, built on the same `EditableFigure` `PositionDimensions.tsx`
uses — `DimensionField` is the Room panel's own field, a different component).
The pan gizmo
(`showPanPuck`) hides while the Room panel is open so it doesn't sit on top of
the wall-length labels; orbit and zoom stay live regardless.

### Drag to another wall

**Floor units (base, tall) have one drop rule.** Dragged more than 150 mm off
their wall they follow the floor, and the release goes through `dropAt`
(`room.ts`): back edge within `SNAP_TO_WALL_MM` of a wall joins that wall, else
the cabinet stands free (see below). The wall tint while dragging reads the
same `wallToJoin`, so the preview and the drop always agree. Within 150 mm of
their own wall they slide along it and stay on it.

**Only wall units hop wall to wall** (`transferTarget`, `floorplan.ts`, from
the pointer's floor point), since they cannot stand free. Either way the move
is `moveToRun`, keeping id, door style and hinge and dropping whatever turn it
had on its old wall. A wall unit's custom hang height survives the move only if
it's still valid on the new wall; otherwise it resets.

### Free-standing cabinets

A base or tall unit can stand away from every wall — `RoomLayout.free`, each
entry a centre (`xMm`, `zMm`) and a yaw, never a `hangAtMm`: a free cabinet
always stands on the floor. Wall-hung and corner units can't go free — they
need a wall or a corner to exist.

On drop, if the cabinet's back edge lands within **150 mm**
(`SNAP_TO_WALL_MM`, `room.ts`) of a wall, it joins that wall's run through the
same `moveToRun` path; otherwise it stays free at the drop point. While
dragging, `clampIntoPlan` (`floorplan.ts`) keeps the cabinet's footprint inside
the room — pushed against a wall it slides along it, and a drop aimed into the
L's notch lands just outside it. `dropAt` still refuses a centre in the notch
for any caller that skips the clamp; everywhere else inside the room outline,
clear of other cabinets' footprints, is valid. A free
cabinet is drawn as a one-cabinet `Run` built from `freeView` — the same view
`pricing.ts` reads — so the worktop, kick board, doors and end panels are the
existing `Run` code, not a special case. It prices as a run of one: its own
worktop (base only), its own kick board wherever a run would bill one, both
sides charged as end panels. The exposed back is not charged — see Open
questions. While a free cabinet stands, the engine only gates further edits on
"does this create a new free-cabinet problem" (still overlapping, still
outside the room); checkout stays strict and re-validates fully.

`lib/planner` must stay framework-free. Everything in it is `(layout, catalogue) => result`. This lets us:

- build and test the whole engine against fixtures before any UI exists
- run the same code client-side for instant feedback and server-side as the authority
- lift the folder into Factory Tracker in Phase 4 without dragging UI along

If a change to `lib/planner` requires importing React or three.js, the change is wrong.

### The catalogue is a parameter, never a global

`catalogue.ts` holds the **seed**: the settings a fresh database starts with
(door styles, finishes, rooms), the invented families tests use as fixtures, and
the fallbacks (`CONSTRUCTION`, `RATES`) that fill in whatever a published
catalogue omits. The seed publishes no cabinets. `PLANNER_CATALOGUE` is frozen. Nothing swaps it.

The live catalogue comes from the published `CatalogueVersion` and is passed
explicitly to the three things that consume it:

- `plannerEngine(catalogue)` — the placement functions in `layout.ts`, bound to
  one catalogue. A factory rather than a per-function parameter because
  `positioned` is the only place a `familyId` becomes a `Family`, but nearly
  every export reaches it.
- `computePlannerPrice(layout, finish, catalogue)` — the money path, which also
  takes its rates off that catalogue via `ratesOf`.
- `<CatalogueProvider catalogue={…}>` in `components/planner/CatalogueContext.tsx`
  — the client tree, which reads `useCatalogue()` for palettes and `useEngine()`
  for placement.

This replaced a mutable module palette that `setActivePlannerCatalogue` swapped
in place. It was three bugs at once: a door-price copy that never got swapped, a
global mutated during React's render phase, and a server-rendered starter layout
built from the seed but priced against the published catalogue — which fell
through `?? 0` whenever a publish changed a size ladder. A fourth, quieter bug
rode along with it: `pricing.ts` read worktop, ceiling-trim, skirting and all
three end-panel rates off the module-level `RATES` global rather than the
catalogue argument, so on the server — where price is authoritative — those six
rates always priced at the bundled placeholders regardless of what was
published. "Which catalogue is live" is now a value with an owner.

### Non-negotiables

- **Price is computed server-side.** The client may show an indicative figure; the authoritative number comes from the API. Never trust a client-submitted price.
- **`schemaVersion` on every stored document.** Public share links must survive schema changes. A customer's WhatsApp link rendering wrong is a lost sale.
- **Zod is the single source of truth for types.** Define the schema once, infer TS types from it, validate every API payload. Malformed input on a public endpoint is guaranteed.
- **Sizes are validated against the family's ladder.** Reject off-ladder widths server-side.
- **The catalogue lives in the database.** Cabinets and their prices are `CabinetDesign` rows, rebuilt into a `CatalogueVersion` on every publish — the version table is the price history. The disaster-recovery copy for cabinets is Postgres plus the design files in Blob; `lib/planner/catalogue.ts` seeds only settings. Ship seed changes as their own commit.
- **Every admin route calls `requireAuth`.** `lib/auth/route.ts`'s `withAuth` wraps every handler under `src/app/api/admin`, with one named exemption in the coverage test's allow-list (`logistics/easyparcel/callback/route.ts` — EasyParcel's own redirect, checked by its `state` cookie instead), and the test fails the build on any other exported method it does not see gated — see [Auth](#auth).
- **A WhatsApp message is queued in the same transaction as the change it reports**, deduplicated by `dedupeKey` — except delivery booked, which queues after the booking commits so a failed insert can never roll back money spent at a carrier. Preview deployments never get `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`.

## 3D

**The planner draws the model the drafter drew.** EzCabinet designs every
cabinet in SketchUp and exports it as OBJ. That drawing is the deliverable, and
the software's job is to ingest it and put it in front of a customer — not to
re-derive a cabinet somebody has already drawn.

This reverses what this document said until August 2026. The old rule —
*"nothing in the scene is an image or a loaded model"* — rebuilt every cabinet
from eleven extracted numbers, and the visible result was a Häfele Axilo 48
leveller rendered as a plain grey cylinder. The three arguments for it do not
survive contact with the numbers:

| The old objection | What is actually true |
| --- | --- |
| "Heavy web geometry that fights the mobile budget" | The client's whole wall run is **8,058 verts / 13,896 triangles**. As binary that is **176 KB** — about what *one* of their decor photos costs (`Rhone Oak.jpg` is 178 KB). One cabinet is ~25 KB, ~13 KB gzipped. The old figure was measuring OBJ *text*, which is ASCII floats at ~6× the binary. |
| "A baked mesh cannot resize to the size ladder" | True, and irrelevant: a cabinet never resizes. The client draws **one export per width** — BC 800, BC 900, BC 1000 — and each is its own cabinet. |
| "No parameters, so it can never produce a price or a BOM" | Price and BOM come from the layout document and the catalogue row. Geometry never fed them and still does not. The mesh is purely visual. |

### What is drawn from a file, and what is not

| | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Cabinet geometry | **the drafted mesh, 1:1** |
| Room shell — floor, walls, ceiling | procedural. No file describes the customer's room |
| Worktop spanning a run | procedural. It crosses cabinets, so no single export has it |
| Finish, door style | **our** materials, painted per classified mesh group |
| Price | the design row, all-in; door styles add a surcharge |

### Classified at intake, not at runtime

`lib/mesh/renderMesh.ts` converts an upload once, on the server, and the browser
receives grouped binary geometry — never an OBJ, never a loader.

```
BC 800mm.obj  (private Blob — carries their part naming)
      ↓  readObjMesh · normalise · classify        (lib/mesh)
      ↓  bucket triangles by role, write binary
  cabinet mesh  ~42 KB / ~13 KB gzipped
   groups: carcass · door · drawerFront · shelf · hardware · other
      ↓  GET /api/cabinet-mesh/[id]   (public, immutable)
  DesignedCabinet.tsx → BufferGeometry
```

**The mesh is grouped by role, and that is load-bearing.** Two features carry
the sale, and both need to know which triangles are fronts:

- the **finish picker**, which paints the customer's colour onto exactly the
  surfaces a sprayer would paint;
- the **doors-open/hidden toggle**, which hides those groups and nothing else.

`roles.ts` already classifies from the drafter's own group names (`Door_L_`,
`G-UEnd_(R)`). That classification used to be discarded; now it decides the
buckets. The drafter's own materials are dropped — the export carries ~900 KB of
re-encoded texture copies (`RotText12.jpg`) whose names map to nothing, and the
grain tile tinted per finish is both smaller and better.

**Nothing is dropped for being unrecognised.** A record `roles.ts` cannot place
goes to `other` and is still drawn, with a neutral material. `readObj` discards
`G-Object.041` as carrying no readable design intent — but in the client's own
sample job that record *is* the adjustable feet. Unrecognised is not unwanted.

**`Cabinet.tsx` is the fallback, not the primary.** Six procedural boxes rebuilt
from `parts.ts`, still rendered for a family with no published mesh: every
catalogue published before this, and any design whose file would not convert. Do
not delete it — a design that fails to parse must still be sellable.

The custom binary format (`ICBMESH1`: magic, a JSON group table, `Float32`
positions, `Uint32` indices) is hand-rolled for the same reason
`scripts/generate-grain-texture.mjs` hand-rolls a PNG — a GLB writer is a
dependency and an exporter's worth of spec for a file only this app reads.

### Design intake lives in `src/lib/mesh/CLAUDE.md`

How a file becomes a cabinet — scale and up-axis inference, which end is the
wall, panel roles, run grouping, the two intake paths, and the additive merge —
is documented next to the code that does it, and loads when you work there.

### Coverage is the thing to watch

A rung with no `meshDesignId` falls back to procedural geometry, and that is
fine — but it is invisible unless something says so, and the first look at the
planner proved it. One rung of thirty had a design, the kitchen starter layout
happened to place none of them, so every cabinet on screen was fallback and the
generic leg read as a broken feature rather than a missing file.

So `/admin/cabinet-designs` shows, on every design row, what it converted to —
its triangle count, or "no mesh — drawn procedurally" — and whether it is live,
edited but unpublished, or leaving at the next publish.

**A design whose file would not convert stays sellable**, drawn procedurally.
Refusing it would make 1:1 a guarantee rather than a maybe; the admin row says
which ones are procedural instead.

### `parts.ts`, and what it is still for

`lib/planner/parts.ts` returns every box in one *procedural* cabinet — sides,
top, bottom, back, legs, shelves, door leaves, drawer fronts — as
`{ role, index, centreMm, sizeMm }` in the cabinet's own frame. `Cabinet.tsx`
renders the fallback from it and `measure.ts` snaps against it. Both used to
derive the interior separately, which left the measuring tool knowing only the
outer bounding box: a shelf gap, a door reveal and a board thickness were all
unmeasurable.

`familySchema.geometry` feeds it: `shelves`, `fixedShelves`, `doorLeaves`,
`drawers`, `hasBack`, `legs`, `legHeightMm`, `legDiameterMm` and `legInsetMm`,
read off the design at intake, so the fallback at least has the right counts and
the right hardware. `standOf` floats a base carcass on feet when the design
recorded them and falls back to the recessed plinth otherwise.

The leg dimensions matter more than they look. On the client's own file the feet
are **2,248 of 2,344 triangles — 96%** of the model; the carcass is 60, the door
24, the shelf 12. They are the one place a fallback visibly differs from the
drawing, which is exactly what got noticed first. `geometryOf` measures them
(57mm across, 17mm in) rather than guessing (50 and 35), so a design whose mesh
failed still falls back with the right feet.

Zero in either field means "not recorded" and `parts.ts` keeps its constants —
which is why they are not defaulted to those constants in the schema. A real
50mm foot and an unrecorded one have to stay distinguishable.

**Exposed ends wear the door finish.** `exposure.ts` answers which outer sides of
a cabinet have no neighbour touching them, and `PlannerScene` passes it down so
an end-of-run side renders as a veneered end panel rather than plain carcass
board — the most camera-facing surface in the default 3/4 view. Every such side
is also a charged panel, and `exposureOf` in `layout.ts` is the one answer both
the scene and `pricing.ts` read. A side is covered by anything within one board
(`panelThicknessMm`) that shares its height, whichever row it is in — so a wall
unit is buried against a tall unit, and a lifted base is not buried by the one
below it. Two rules EzCabinet confirmed on 2026-09-13: a tall unit's side beside a shorter
cabinet counts as covered, and `G-UEnd_(L)/(R)` is the carcass side, so panels
are charged on top of a design's all-in price, not inside it.

**The measuring tool snaps to whichever geometry is actually drawn.**
`snapToCabinet` takes the drafted mesh's group boxes when one has loaded and
falls back to `cabinetPartsMm` when it has not. That is not a nicety: a
dimension line taken against an idealised shelf while the scene draws the real
one is a wrong number shown to a customer. `PlannerScene` reads the mesh
synchronously through `peekDesignMesh`, because a pointer handler cannot await —
and a null there is correct rather than a race, since no mesh means procedural
boxes are what is on screen.

Onboarding a new design is a **data-entry task, not a 3D-modeling task**: name
it, price it, publish it. That is what lets one person maintain the catalogue.

- Lazy-load the 3D bundle behind `Suspense` so it never blocks LCP on the landing page
- `dpr={[1, 2]}`
- **Lighting is `components/planner/Lighting.tsx`, and nothing else adds a light.** One shadow-casting key light, off to one side of the room (see `KEY_OFFSET_M` in `lightingRig.ts` for why), plus one non-shadow fill from the opposite side (`FILL_INTENSITY`/`FILL_OFFSET_M`) that brightens cabinet fronts on the key's own wall without a second shadow to reconcile; an environment from drei `Lightformer`s rendered once (`frames={1}`) — never an HDR file; Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapping, so a finish renders as the colour the admin typed. UI and overlay materials set `toneMapped={false}`.
- **The shadow map is redrawn on change, never per frame.** `SHADOW_MAP` has `autoUpdate: false`; anything that moves a caster calls `markShadowsDirty()` (`lightingRig.ts`) — layout edits, a drag, a door animating, a drafted mesh arriving. Orbiting needs nothing, since the light is fixed in the world. Set shadow-map options through the Canvas `shadows` prop only: R3F re-applies it on every Canvas render.
- **Two quality tiers, `low` and `high`, chosen by measured frame rate** (`PerformanceMonitor`, never user-agent). `high` adds a 2048² shadow map and N8AO ambient occlusion from `HighQualityEffects.tsx`, which is lazy-loaded so a `low` device never downloads postprocessing. `?quality=high|low` forces a tier in development.
- **A captured screenshot renders at `high`** regardless of the device's tier — it is the image that goes out over WhatsApp. (Capture is not built yet; whoever builds it owns this.)
- **One grayscale grain texture, tinted per finish via material colour.** `public/grain.png` is 512², ~54KB, generated by `pnpm generate:grain`, and every surface in the scene shares it. Do not ship a separate 2K PBR set per finish — eight finishes of 2K maps will destroy load time on mobile data
- **The floor is a second greyscale tile, `public/floor.png`**, drawn by the same script: SPC planks (1220 × 180mm, staggered joints, micro-bevel) tinted oak in `Room.tsx`. A generated woodgrain is allowed there and only there — the floor is room context, not a board anyone is sold
- **A finish can override that with a real decor photo.** The `finish:<id>` site-image slot feeds both the landing swatch and the 3D door, so uploading one supplier decor scan makes the strip and the cabinet show the same board. The photo becomes the front's `map` with the material colour set to white; the grain tile stays on as the roughness map. Absent an upload, the generated grain tinted by `finish.hex` is the fallback — see `components/planner/grain.ts`.
- **Decor scans are the supplier's IP.** Board suppliers (Max World and the like) publish decor images for their own catalogue; they are production print masters, not stock photography. Get written permission before putting one on a public page — for a fabricator that buys the board this is normally just a request to the rep
- **The geometry is not the problem; the textures are.** Measured on the client's own export: a whole wall run is 176 KB of binary geometry, one cabinet ~25 KB (~13 KB gzipped). One decor scan is 178 KB. Budget accordingly — the reflex to cut triangles is aimed at the wrong thing here.
- **Meshes are served `immutable` and fetched once per SKU.** The pathname carries the source file's sha256, so a given URL's bytes never change; `DesignedCabinet.tsx` caches the *promise*, so four identical base units in a run are one request. Prefetch sibling ladder rungs if changing a width ever feels slow.
- **A design past `MAX_TRIANGLES` (200,000) is refused** and falls back to procedural. That is not a cabinet — it is a whole room, or a file with the furniture library left switched on.
- `InstancedMesh` for shelves/drawers only if a design gets large enough to need it

Two features carry the sale: a **doors-open / doors-hidden toggle** so the customer sees their interior, and a **canvas screenshot** attached to the quote. That screenshot going out over WhatsApp is what closes the lead.

## Where assets live

| Kind | Home | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grain/laminate textures | `/public` | Static, versioned with code, free off Vercel CDN |
| Palette thumbnails | Inline SVG (`components/planner/thumbs.tsx`) | Drawn from the family's own proportions. Never boot a WebGL context per thumbnail. |
| Design exports (`.obj`, or `.zip` with textures) | Vercel Blob, **private** | The source file carries the client's module standard, layer structure and part naming. Never public, never in `/public`. Reachable only under `/api/admin`. |
| Derived render meshes (`.icbmesh`) | Vercel Blob, served **public** via `/api/cabinet-mesh/[id]` | The geometry a customer's browser draws, so it has to get out — but only as triangles, with the drafter's materials and every part name stripped. The store is private-access-only, so the route is the hole, exactly like site images. Regenerable from the source, so it is cache, not record. |
| Homepage / room / finish photos | Vercel Blob, public | Slot-keyed (`hero`, `room:<id>`, `finish:<id>`), uploaded at `/admin/site-content`. Slots are derived from the live catalogue, not hardcoded, so adding a finish adds its photo slot |
| Canvas screenshots | Vercel Blob | User-generated at runtime, one per lead |
| Quote PDFs | Vercel Blob | Same |
| Tutorial videos | **Mux**, not Blob | Needs transcoding, adaptive bitrate and a poster frame. Blob would serve one giant MP4 to a phone on Malaysian mobile data |
| Catalogue versions, designs, tutorials, site-image slots, leads, Blob URLs | Postgres | |

Test: if you could delete it and rebuild it from a `git clone`, it belongs in the repo, not Blob.

**Never base64 images into a Postgres column.** A design export is ~2 MB; a screenshot is tens of KB; a render mesh is ~42 KB. All of them live in Blob and only the pathname lives in a column. `CabinetDesign.meshGroups` is the one piece of derived geometry in Postgres, and it is a role/triangle-count summary for the review table — the planner never reads it, because the binary carries its own group table.

## UX flow

Three screens. Rooms open on an **empty wall**: there is no invented starter run to price, and one assembled from whatever designs exist would look random. Blank canvases still cost conversion, which is what the preset designs below are for.

1. **Start** — pick a room; a room with no designs yet is shown as coming soon and cannot be picked
2. **Studio** — an empty room opens on the Room panel (shape, wall lengths, ceiling) with a **Next: add cabinets** button, since a wall cannot shrink below what its cabinets need; then drag cabinets in from a menu grouped by category, choose door style and finish, measure. A placed cabinet always wears a door style — its price includes the door
3. **Checkout** — one page: contact, delivery, and (with a gateway live) Stripe's Payment Element drawing only the payment method, then one **Pay** button that creates the order and confirms its payment → `/[lang]/order/[token]`. With no gateway (`payment-gateway` flag on `manual`) it is **Place order**, and the order page shows bank transfer details until an admin marks it paid

**An order is priced on the server, never by the client.** `POST /api/orders` (public, guarded by BotID) runs `validateOrder` — the engine forgives an unknown family or an off-ladder width silently, which is fine on a canvas and wrong for a payment — then `priceOrder` against the published catalogue, and stores the design as `{ schemaVersion, layout }` with the catalogue version it was priced against. A paid order's **Create delivery** (`/admin/logistics?fromOrder=`) fills the delivery form with one row per cabinet at its designed size and the design row's weight; the delivery create route refuses an order that is not paid.

**An order records the terms it was placed under.** Checkout requires a
ticked terms box; `POST /api/orders` refuses a body without
`termsAccepted: true` and stamps `Order.termsVersion` (`TERMS_VERSION`,
`lib/orders/terms.ts`) and `termsAcceptedAt`. Bump `TERMS_VERSION` by hand
whenever the wording of `/[lang]/terms` or `/[lang]/refunds` changes in
meaning. Both pages and the privacy notice are **drafts**, rendered by
`components/LegalPage.tsx` from `lib/copy`; the refund policy's boundary is
`Order.productionStage` being set. There is no refund or cancel flow in the
app.

**No login to configure — but checkout now requires an account.** Browsing, planning and pricing stay anonymous; `POST /api/orders` is the one hard stop — signed out, placing an order bounces to `/[lang]/sign-in?next=…` and back to the same quote, the design intact via the autosaved draft (`lib/plannerDraft.ts`). A separate, earlier email/WhatsApp gate at **"save & share"** — for the customer who has sunk time into a design and will trade a phone number to keep it — is designed but **not yet built**; see Status and Phasing.

**An order is its owner's.** Every order carries the account that placed it
(`Order.userId`, `NOT NULL`). `/[lang]/orders` lists the signed-in customer's
own orders; `/[lang]/order/[token]` and — for a delivery that belongs to an
order — `/[lang]/track/[token]` open only for that account or staff with
`orders:read` (`lib/orders/access.ts`). The token in the URL is an address,
not a key: signed out, it bounces through Google sign-in and back; signed in
as anyone else, it is the same 404 as a made-up token. A standalone
admin-booked delivery keeps link access — its recipient has no account.

**The account area** is the route group `app/[lang]/(account)/` — My orders
and each order page inside one layout (`SiteHeader` + "Your account" side
nav); route groups leave URLs unchanged. The layout only reads who is signed
in; access stays in each page (`viewerOf`, `canViewOrder`). `AccountMenu`
reads the session in the browser so the statically rendered landing page,
which also shows it, stays static. Profile, WhatsApp number, saved addresses
and saved designs are later pieces of the Claude Design "Customer Account"
file; customer sign-in stays Google only.

**Not yet built.** Save writes the layout to Postgres under a `nanoid` slug, returns a short URL, creates the lead record, and attaches the screenshot. Then a `wa.me` deep link with the design URL prefilled.

Ship 8–10 **preset designs** as their own indexable routes ("2.4m 3-door kitchen run", etc). Each is an SEO landing page and an entry point into the planner — solves the blank-canvas problem and the traffic problem together.

### The studio's own chrome

- **A breadcrumb header** (`PlannerHeader.tsx`) instead of a stepper — the planner is one screen you stay on, not a wizard.
- **3D / elevation / plan toggle** (`PlannerView` in `PlannerScene.tsx`). Elevation faces the **target wall** — whichever wall is tapped in 3D or plan view becomes the target, and elevation reframes to face it; there is no separate side view any more. Elevation and plan are orthographic and axis-locked: the point of an elevation is that it stays square, so one stray drag must not knock it off.
- **Room dimensions are editable in place** (`DimensionField.tsx`), ceiling height among them — it is a layout dimension in `PlannerLayout`, clamped by `CEILING_LIMITS`, not a constant, because it decides whether a tall unit fits.
- **Room shape and wall lengths** are in the Room panel and, in plan view, on the walls themselves (`WallLengths.tsx`).

### Tutorials

`/tutorials` is a public DIY video library; `/admin/tutorials` uploads to Mux with `@mux/upchunk` (direct-to-Mux, so the video never passes through a function) and polls `[id]/status` until the asset is ready. `lib/mux.ts` is `server-only` — those are write credentials for the video account and must never reach a customer's bundle.

This is the one place the app streams something it did not generate. It is a separate surface from the planner and shares nothing with it.

### Telemetry

PostHog **Cloud EU**, installed from the Vercel Marketplace, so we can see where customers drop out of the funnel and what broke in their browser. Vercel Web Analytics could not do that job — anonymous aggregate counts, no per-visitor journeys, no replay, no alerts — so it runs beside PostHog as a plain page-view count, never instead of it.

- **One module:** `lib/analytics.ts` — `track`, `captureError`, consent. `posthog-js` is imported on idle, never on the LCP path. `<Analytics>` mounts in `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` only; **admin is not tracked**.
- **Through our origin:** `next.config.ts` rewrites `/api/ph/*` to the EU hosts, so ad blockers do not hide drop-offs. `/api/` already bypasses the locale redirect and the admin gate. The region is hardcoded there and in `analytics.ts` because PostHog fixes it at install.
- **Consent (PDPA s.129):** cookieless until the visitor accepts (`opt_out_capturing_by_default` + `cookieless_mode: "on_reject"` — drop the first and "pending" sets cookies). Accepting enables cookies and the error-triggered replay. `/[lang]/privacy` is a **draft** for EzCabinet's counsel.
- **Never send form fields.** No `identify()` with phone or email, nothing a customer types in any event payload. Replay masks inputs.
- **Journey events** are a typed union in `analytics.ts`, fired from existing handlers — one per customer decision, never per pointer move. `quote_submitted` fires after `POST /api/orders` answers 201 — a placed order, not a button press.
- **Breakage:** `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, WebGL context loss in `PlannerScene`, and mesh-load failures in `DesignedCabinet` (the procedural fallback hides them on screen).
- **Room shapes changed two event payloads.** `room_shape_changed.shape` is now `rect | l | l-mirror` (was `straight | left | right`); `quote_viewed.wallMm` now means the back wall's length (`wallsOf(plan)[0].lengthMm`), not the room's one wall. Update any PostHog insight or funnel filtering on these values.
- **Vercel Speed Insights and Web Analytics** (`@vercel/speed-insights`, `@vercel/analytics`), mounted beside `<Analytics>`, so public pages only. Both are cookieless, so no consent gate, and both send nothing until toggled on in the project dashboard. Speed Insights is the free tier: the Real Experience Score only, 10,000 events per 30 days shared across the team, and ingestion pauses for 14 days past that cap (Plus is US$10 per project per month). Web Analytics on Pro has no free events: US$0.03 per 1,000 page views, drawn from the Pro usage credit. Page views only — no custom events; journeys stay in PostHog. Together they add ~6 KB gzipped, deferred, and one beacon per page view. `_vercel` is excluded from the `proxy.ts` matcher, or the beacons get a locale redirect. Neither alerts on failures; that is PostHog and the 5xx rule below.
- **Alerts → Slack:** PostHog error-tracking alerts (new/reopened issue, spike) and a funnel insight alert; server 5xx via the Vercel rule in `docs/ops/vercel-5xx-alert.json`.

## Auth

Accounts, with three roles: `SUPERADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER`. Customers sign
in with Google. Staff are invited by a superadmin and can use either Google or
the password that superadmin set. A staff account promoted from an existing
customer row keeps only the sign-in it already had, so a Google-only staff
member has no password fallback — the OAuth-misconfigured escape hatch only
exists for a row the superadmin created directly. Public sign-up can only ever
produce a `CUSTOMER`; a role is granted only by a superadmin acting on
`/admin/users`.

`lib/auth/permissions.ts` is the whole access model: nine permissions and a
`Role → Permission[]` constant, with a table-driven test that is its
specification. The permission names outlive the roles that motivated them —
`SALES` and `CATALOGUE` were specified and dropped, and reinstating either is
one row in that table rather than an audit of 29 route handlers.

`proxy.ts` only redirects; the boundary is `requireAuth()`, called by every
admin page and API route, and a test fails the build if one forgets. Roles are
never written into the session, so a role change or an offboarding bites on the
next request.

An invited staff row is created with `emailVerified: true`. That is not
cosmetic: Better Auth refuses to link a Google account to a row whose email is
unverified, and this app deliberately sends no verification email, so without it no
staff member could ever use the Google button. The superadmin typing a
colleague's work address is the assertion that it is theirs.

`AUTH_ENABLED=false` opens the admin surface and lets you open any customer
order page, for local work. It never lets checkout take an anonymous order —
every order needs an owner. Signed out, a local order belongs to one seeded
demo customer (`lib/auth/demoCustomer.ts`), so the planner can be demonstrated
end to end without Google; the quote screen learns this from
`/api/payments/config` and skips its sign-in card. It is
ignored whenever `VERCEL_ENV` is set — preview included, since a preview is a
public URL with real carrier credentials behind it. On customer order pages a
real Google session still wins over the bypass user, so local My orders lists
the signed-in account's orders.

Public password sign-up is closed (`disabledPaths: ["/sign-up/email"]` in
`lib/auth.ts`); invites and the seed call `auth.api.signUpEmail` server-side,
which the router never sees. Promoting an existing customer row strips any
password and session it carries before granting the role — a customer row
with a password was made by someone other than the address's owner.

**Staff with a password need a second factor.** Better Auth's `twoFactor`
plugin (TOTP + backup codes); `AuthUser.mustSetupTwoFactor` is derived on
every read by `needsTwoFactorSetup` (`lib/auth/twoFactor.ts`) and enforced
beside `mustChangePassword` — `withAuth` refuses, `requirePage` redirects to
`/admin/setup-2fa`. Google-only staff are exempt, and the plugin gates
`/sign-in/email` only, so a staff member with both a password and a linked
Google account can still enter through Google without a code: accepted.
`/two-factor/disable` is closed; the only way to remove a second factor is a
superadmin's **Reset 2FA** on `/admin/users`, or `pnpm auth:reset-2fa <email>`
when the last superadmin is the one locked out. A superadmin can also press
**Remove password** on `/admin/users` to make a Google-linked staff account
Google-only (refused when it has no other sign-in), which the 2FA rule exempts
— the way out for staff who only use Google and never learned the invite
password. Both Reset 2FA and Remove password log the actor's and target's ids.

**Suspend is reversible; Delete is not.** A superadmin's **Delete** on
`/admin/users` (`lib/auth/deleteUser.ts`) removes the row with its sessions,
sign-ins and second factor. It is refused on your own row and on any account
that placed orders — `Order.userId` is `Restrict`, so that account can only
be suspended. Orders a deleted staff member marked paid keep the name in
`Order.paidByName`; only `paidByUserId` goes null.

**Forgot password is email, staff only, and only after enrolment.**
`sendStaffReset` (`lib/auth/passwordReset.ts`) mails a link through Resend
(`lib/email.ts`, one `fetch`) when `canEmailReset` allows it: staff role, not
disabled, has a password, 2FA enabled. Better Auth's reset would otherwise
create a password on a customer row, and a mailbox alone must not be enough
to enrol an authenticator. The link never touches the second factor.
`RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` are production-only, like `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-rbac-design.md`.

## Relationship to Factory Tracker

Separate repository, deliberately. Factory Tracker is an authenticated B2B dashboard where bundle size barely matters; this is a public marketing surface where three.js weight decides whether the lead ever loads the page. Different audiences, deploy cadences, and risk profiles. A planner hotfix must not redeploy a system the factory floor depends on.

Phase 4 integration is a **versioned HTTP contract**, not a monorepo. Factory Tracker exposes `POST /api/v1/production-orders`; the planner calls it with a signed payload. Extract a shared types package only if that becomes painful.

Separate Postgres database from Factory Tracker.

## Phasing

| Phase | Work |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Catalogue + pricing spec workshop with client, including the design-intake process |
| 1 | Layout schema, rules, pricing — headless, tested against fixtures ✅ |
| 2 | Planner UI + 3D scene ✅ |
| 3 | Lead capture, share links, admin inbox (admin catalogue + designs ✅; paid checkout, orders admin, order → delivery pre-fill ✅; share links and a real payment gateway not started); L-shaped kitchens ✅ |
| 4 | Approved quote → **SKU list** → production job in Factory Tracker. Factory Tracker pushes production stages onto `POST /api/admin/orders/[id]/stage` (today an admin presses it). |

**Phase 4 changed shape when the planner started rendering the drafted model.** A derived cut list is no longer available, because the app no longer derives the cabinet — it draws the one the client already drew. What Factory Tracker receives is a SKU list (`1× BC 800mm`). For a factory that manufactures to standard modules that is arguably the more useful payload, but it is a change to the contract and **the client should hear it**.

## Known issues

Recorded rather than fixed. Do not paper over them; fix them deliberately.

1. **Drafter naming is load-bearing now.** `roles.ts` classifies mesh groups from the drafter's own names, and that classification decides which triangles take the customer's finish and which disappear on the doors-hidden toggle. A renamed group used to cost an inferred shelf count; it now costs the finish picker on that cabinet. The review table shows the classification before publish and the fallback is one material across the whole mesh, but this belongs in the Phase 0 conversation about drafting conventions.
2. **Until the first publish after the one-design-one-cabinet change, the live catalogue is the old one** — seed families with invented prices, and the junk `Testing123` among them. The first publish from `/admin/cabinet-designs` rebuilds it from design rows and removes them all. Set the base door style's surcharge to RM 0 before that publish, or every cabinet is charged its door twice.
3. **EasyParcel's webhooks are unsigned.** Nothing in their payload identifies the sender, so the callback URL carries a secret query token and that is the entire check — see `verifyWebhook` in `adapters/easyparcel.ts`.
4. **`pnpm easyparcel:ping` is the only thing that checks EasyParcel's real API shape**; CI runs against recorded fixtures and cannot see a renamed field. Run it before a release that touches `lib/logistics`, or wire it to a scheduled workflow with the credentials as repository secrets. It is deliberately not in PR CI: it needs secrets in the runner, it fails on EasyParcel's downtime rather than on our bugs, and a partner outage must not block an unrelated merge.
5. **City-Link is still a stub, and its API cannot price.** Its guide (Testing V1.21) documents a login, a shipment request and tracking — no rate operation, no cancel, no webhook — so a City-Link row would carry no price, an admin would undo a booking by phoning them, and tracking would be the cron poll only. The booking body's nesting is unverified: the guide groups the fields but prints no sample request. Plan and payloads in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-16-citylink-carrier-adapter.md`; nothing is built.
6. **Corner doors stay shut on the doors-open toggle.** A drafted leaf deeper than half its width — an L corner unit's two touching leaves merge into one L-shaped leaf in `splitDoorLeaves` — is kept shut in `DesignedCabinet.tsx`, because `swingOf` assumes every leaf faces +z and would pivot it through the carcass. The procedural fallback of a corner unit is a plain box whose front the side run half covers, so it is never turned — every corner is the left-hand corner of the wall after it — and its doors stay shut too. Revisit both once EzCabinet's real corner export is seen.
7. **Free cabinets have no resize, replace or duplicate yet** — those controls are hidden on a free selection. **No floor-follow drag in elevation view**, since elevation is a flat wall-facing projection with nowhere for "off the wall" to go. **Switching to an L is refused silently** while a free cabinet stands in the notch's would-be area — the room panel just doesn't move. **A free cabinet can stand under an empty corner square's billed worktop**: `runFootprints` ignores an empty reserved corner square, so nothing stops a free cabinet occupying the same floor space that corner's worktop is priced over.
8. **A journey event fired next to a redirect can be lost.** `track()` in `lib/analytics.ts` loads `posthog-js` on idle and captures asynchronously, with no `sendBeacon` or `keepalive`. `sign_in_nudge` with `action: "accepted"` fires and is immediately followed by the Google OAuth redirect, so that leg of the sign-in funnel will under-count — the browser can navigate away before the beacon goes out. Not new, and not unique to that event: any event fired next to a redirect has the same problem. The fix, when someone wants one, is a `keepalive` fetch or firing the event server-side after the callback, and both are decisions about the funnel rather than cleanup.
9. **The Customers filter on `/admin/users` narrows client-side over a capped list.** `GET /api/admin/users` has `take: 200`, and `staff=0` drops the `NOT: { role: "CUSTOMER" }` clause rather than adding a customer-only one, so that cap is shared across staff and customers and the browser filters the result afterwards. A public planner accumulates customer sign-ups steadily, so once total accounts pass 200 the Customers view silently shows an incomplete list with nothing in the UI saying so. The fix is a `role` parameter on the endpoint's existing `where`, which removes both the truncation and the over-fetch of rows the customer view discards. Growth debt on an endpoint that is already reviewed and gated, not a defect: with three accounts today it cannot bite.
10. **Resolved: `mustChangePassword` is enforced.** `withAuth` refuses and `requirePage` redirects to `/admin/change-password` while it is set. Kept as a numbered entry so references to issue 11 stay valid.
11. **`advance` takes its actor from the session; `book` and `split` still take a client-typed one.** `DeliveryDetail.tsx`'s name field feeds `bookedBy` and `split`'s `actor`, and `split` falls back to the literal `"Admin"` when the field is left blank — so the delivery activity log has mixed provenance, a session user's real name on some rows and whatever an admin typed (or nothing) on others. Narrowed, not closed.
12. **`prisma.config.ts` sets no `shadowDatabaseUrl`.** That is why `prisma migrate dev` refuses non-interactively and `prisma migrate diff --from-migrations` cannot run — both need a shadow database to diff against. Until it is set, a migration written outside an interactive terminal has to be hand-written and independently verified (`prisma migrate diff --from-config-datasource --to-schema`) rather than generated. The fix is two lines in `prisma.config.ts` pointing at a disposable shadow database URL; not done here.
13. **FedEx's sandbox cannot check our requests.** It answers only its own canned inputs — any request that differs from a documented example returns `SERVICE.PACKAGECOMBINATION.INVALID`, and its canned Malaysian rates are USD — so `adapters/fedex.ts` is tested against fixtures built from FedEx's documented shapes, not against FedEx. `pnpm fedex:ping` against **production** checks only the token, rate and track calls — it never ships. Ship, pickup, both cancels and the label fetch are first exercised by the first real booking: run it once production credentials exist, watch it with FedEx Ship Manager open, and cancel it there if anything looks wrong. Production also needs label certification with FedEx, which can take weeks.
14. **Forgot-password throttling is per account, not per network.** `sendStaffReset` runs after the response (`after()`), so the answer and its timing are the same whoever asked, and it sends nothing once an account has more than three live reset links (about three mails an hour). What remains: Better Auth's own limit on `/request-password-reset` is per IP and memory-backed, so it does not hold across serverless instances, and a requester can still create unsent reset tokens in the `verification` table for any address. The three-link cap counts those unsent requests too, so about four requests an hour from anyone suppress a staff member's own reset mail while the page still says it was sent. Low value with three staff; the fix is `rateLimit: { storage: "database" }` and its table.

## Open questions — resolve before trusting pricing.ts

- **Flush ends are no longer charged.** Every room now has side walls all
  round, so a cabinet flush against one (within one board) wears no end
  panel — a straight run re-priced under the new floor plan can drop a
  panel it used to be charged. Tell EzCabinet before an old design's price
  changes on them.
- **Is a free-standing cabinet's exposed back charged as a panel?** The
  engine currently says no — only its two sides are billed as end panels,
  the same as a run's ends. Confirm with EzCabinet.
- **Are a corner unit's ends charged as end panels?** The engine assumes not —
  its ends are part of the drawing (`exposureOf` in `room.ts`). Confirm with
  EzCabinet, and ask whether a kick board runs along a corner unit's faces
  (not drawn or charged yet). Mock corner OBJs for browser testing can be
  generated with `pnpm tsx scripts/generate-corner-mock.ts <dir>`, for upload
  once a safe (non-production) Blob store is available.
- **How does EzCabinet actually price cabinets?** The engine models it **per design, all-in** — each uploaded design carries its own price with its door included, door styles add a per-width surcharge, worktop by the running foot. A customer cannot take a door off to pay less. Confirm that matches their price list.
- **Does the public tool show a firm price or an indicative range?** Sales teams often resist public exact pricing. This is a business decision and it changes the UI.
- **Their real module range** — which widths exist for each cabinet — which is now simply which designs they upload.
- **Their real module standard** for living room, bedroom, and foyer. Only the kitchen dimensions come from a real design export; the rest are invented.
- **What does `Door_L_` mean?** The left-hand leaf of a pair, or a door hinged
  on its left stile? `hingeSideFromName` reads the token, but only trusts it for
  a *lone* door — on a pair the outward rule already answers it, and guessing
  the convention would be reading handedness into what may only be position.
  Their answer decides whether a single door's drawn name can seed its swing.
- **Design-intake cadence.** How often do new exports arrive, and will the panel naming (`G-UEnd_(L)`, `G-Door(R)`, …) stay stable? Extraction depends on it, so a change in their drawing habits is a change to `lib/mesh`.
- **The workshop's real street address and phone.** `WORKSHOP_ADDRESS` is
  `"EzCabinet Sdn Bhd, Klang Valley, Selangor"`, which does not geocode
  to a pin, so Lalamove cannot price a pickup from it — every delivery would be
  quoted from wherever that phrase happens to resolve to. `WORKSHOP_PHONE` is a
  placeholder, and it is the number a Lalamove driver rings from the loading bay.
  `WORKSHOP_POSTCODE`, `WORKSHOP_CITY` and `WORKSHOP_STATE` are placeholders
  derived from `WORKSHOP_PIN`, and EasyParcel prices the origin zone off them —
  a wrong postcode there is a wrong price on every parcel quote. FedEx takes
  the shipper and pickup address from the same constants (GDEX avoided this
  with its account profile; FedEx cannot), plus `WORKSHOP_CLOSE_TIME`, also a
  placeholder.
- **Does EzCabinet's FedEx account sell `FEDEX_PRIORITY` domestically, and in
  MYR?** The adapter prefers it and falls back to the cheapest service
  offered; a non-MYR price is refused rather than shown as RM. Only production
  credentials or their FedEx rep can answer. `FEDEX_PRIORITY_EXPRESS_FREIGHT`
  (freight, over 68 kg) could carry whole cabinets — out of scope, worth
  asking.
- Does Prisma Postgres offer an ap-southeast region? If not, quote submission eats a transpacific round trip.
- Does EzCabinet have an EasyParcel account, and who tops up the wallet? `submit_orders` deducts at booking time and a shipment cannot be booked against an empty wallet.
- **City-Link: a live host, credentials, and whether a rate API exists.** The guide we hold documents only the test server (`devsvr2019a.citylinkexpress.com:21145`) and its credentials page is blank — ask for the company code, account number and meter number, the live URL, and whether anything prices a shipment. Without a rate call an admin compares City-Link blind on price.
- **WhatsApp go-live is waiting on EzCabinet.** Meta Business verification, a dedicated number, a system-user token, a payment method, 21 template approvals, the factory's real stage names, the sales number and counsel's privacy sign-off. Checklist and template copy: `docs/ops/whatsapp-ezcabinet-setup.md`.
- **Which Malaysian payment gateway?** Stripe is wired as the sandbox-test gateway, chosen by the `payment-gateway` Vercel flag (`src/flags.ts`: Stripe on development and preview, manual on production); Fiuu is the likely production one, account in progress. Both are adapters behind `lib/payments` — swap plan in `STRIPE_INTEGRATION_TODO.md`. Only the verified webhook marks an order paid, never the customer's return. With no gateway set, orders fall back to manual bank transfer, and `BANK_TRANSFER` in `lib/orders/payment.ts` is still a placeholder account the confirmation page shows customers.
- **The delivery fee.** `RATES.deliveryFlatRm` is `85`, the figure from the client's Order Confirmation design; set the real one in the catalogue settings. It is flat — one fee whatever the load or the distance.
- **What happens when a paid design changes at re-measure?** The customer pays full price up front; there is no refund or top-up flow, so a re-measure that changes the cabinets is handled outside the app today.
- **Weights.** Parcel partners price by the kilogram. A design row's optional weight pre-fills its delivery rows; every design without one leaves the admin typing it per delivery.
- **The privacy notice, terms of sale and refund policy are drafts**
  (`/[lang]/privacy`, `/terms`, `/refunds`). EzCabinet is the seller and the
  PDPA data controller: their counsel approves the wording, and the PostHog
  DPA should be signed in their legal name. Ask too whether behavioural
  analytics counts as "systematic monitoring" under the DPO guideline, and
  whether their data volumes require appointing a DPO at all. The refund
  windows (7 days to report damage, 14 working days to pay) and the delivery
  estimate (4 to 6 weeks from re-measure) are our defaults; whether the price
  carries SST, and the company's SSM registration number for the seller
  block, are theirs to supply.
  The seller block on the terms page and at checkout reads
  `WORKSHOP_ADDRESS` and `WORKSHOP_PHONE`, both still placeholders — the
  Consumer Protection (Electronic Trade Transactions) Regulations 2024 want
  the registered address there, and the Malay page is the one the law reads. GDPR was checked and does not apply: an
  EU-hosted processor does not bring a Malaysian seller under it.

## Conventions

- Sentence case in UI copy. Prices in RM.
- Every `lib/planner` function gets a test before it gets a caller.
- Commit catalogue changes separately from code changes so price history is greppable.
