/**
 * Book the pickup. The only call in the app that spends money.
 *
 * Four guards, in order of how much they cost to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. Already booked → return what exists. A double-submitted form, a retried
 *    request or an impatient second click must not buy a second lorry.
 * 2. The row is claimed — `carrierOrderId: null` flipped to a `bookedBy` row
 *    — before the adapter is ever called. `@unique` on `carrierOrderId` only
 *    stops two *different* deliveries from sharing one order id; it does
 *    nothing for two concurrent POSTs on the *same* delivery, which both read
 *    null and would otherwise both reach `submit_orders`, double-spending the
 *    wallet and leaving one order id orphaned when the second write
 *    overwrites the first. The `updateMany` below is the actual backstop: it
 *    only touches a row still `carrierOrderId: null`, so only the first of two
 *    racing requests can claim it.
 * 3. The booking call is never retried. `carrierFetch` only retries calls the
 *    adapter marks idempotent, and booking is not one of them.
 * 4. `bookedBy` is required. The handler now runs behind `withAuth`, which
 *    resolves the real signed-in actor — but `book`/`split` still record the
 *    name typed on the confirm step, not that session actor; moving them onto
 *    it is a scheduled follow-up (Known issue 11, CLAUDE.md). Until then, this
 *    client-supplied name plus the event row is the entire record of who
 *    committed the spend.
