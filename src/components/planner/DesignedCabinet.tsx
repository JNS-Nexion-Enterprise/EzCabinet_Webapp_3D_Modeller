 * published design, which means every catalogue published before design intake
 * and any design whose file would not convert.
 *
 * The geometry arrives as classified groups, not one lump, and that is what
 * keeps the two features that carry the sale:
 *
 * - **The finish picker** works because the `door` and `drawerFront` groups are
 *   known, so the customer's finish is painted onto exactly the surfaces a
 *   sprayer would paint. The drafter's own materials are dropped at intake.
 * - **The doors-open toggle** works because those same groups can be hidden
 *   without touching the carcass.
 *
 * No loader ships to the customer. The bytes are positions and indices, and
 * `BufferGeometry` takes them directly.
