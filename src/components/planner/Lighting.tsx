/**
 * The planner's whole lighting rig, in one place so it can be swapped out in
 * one line.
 *
 * Tone mapping is Khronos PBR Neutral rather than R3F's default ACES. ACES
 * shifts hue and crushes highlights, which is why Rhone Oak once rendered
 * near-white and the lights were turned down to compensate. Neutral is built
 * for product renders: colours below the highlight shoulder come out as the
 * admin typed them, and the finish on screen is the finish being sold.
 *
 * The environment is four Lightformer softboxes rendered once into a 256²
 * cube map — `frames={1}`, so it costs nothing per frame, and no HDR file,
 * since a studio HDR is 1–3 MB on Malaysian mobile data. It is what gives
 * glass, handles and the worktop something to reflect.
