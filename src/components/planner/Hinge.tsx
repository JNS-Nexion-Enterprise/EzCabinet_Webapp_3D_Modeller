/**
 * A door leaf that swings on its stile.
 *
 * Shared by both render paths — `Cabinet.tsx` draws procedural leaves and
 * `DesignedCabinet.tsx` draws the drafted mesh, and `Cabinet.tsx` already
 * imports from `DesignedCabinet.tsx`, so this cannot live in either without a
 * cycle.
 *
 * This component decides nothing about geometry. Where the axis sits, how far
 * the leaf opens, and whether it should open at all are worked out by `swingOf`
 * in `lib/planner/swing.ts` from the leaf's own box and the carcass it hangs
 * on — so they are checkable by reading arithmetic rather than pixels. What is
 * left here is the easing.
 *
 * Children stay in the cabinet's own frame: the outer group pivots at the
 * hinge, the inner one undoes that offset. So a caller passes the same
 * absolutely-positioned mesh it drew before and nothing about its coordinates
 * changes.
 *
 * The angle is damped rather than sprung. One eased number does not justify
 * `@react-spring/three` as a dependency, and `MathUtils.damp` is framerate
 * independent — which matters on the mid-range Android this is built for, where
 * a fixed per-frame lerp would swing visibly slower than on a desktop.
