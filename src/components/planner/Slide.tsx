/**
 * A drawer that runs out of its carcass.
 *
 * The counterpart to `Hinge`, and deliberately its twin: same damped easing,
 * same settle-exactly-once rule, driven by the same `openIds` set. A door that
 * swings while the drawer bank beside it stays shut is the thing that reads as
 * broken — a run either opens or it does not.
 *
 * Straight translation along +z, because a drawer has no pivot to derive. How
 * far is `drawerTravelMm` in `lib/planner/parts.ts`, so the number is testable
 * arithmetic rather than a constant buried in a component.
 *
 * Children stay in the cabinet's own frame: this group starts at the origin and
 * moves, so a caller passes the same absolutely-positioned mesh it drew before.
