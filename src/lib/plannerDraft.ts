/**
 * The customer's work-in-progress design, kept in the browser.
 *
 * Signing in navigates away from the page — Google's redirect takes the whole
 * document, and with it the R3F scene and every piece of React state. So the
 * layout is written down on every change rather than at the moment we happen
 * to ask for an account. That also survives a refresh, a crash and a closed
 * tab, which no amount of prompting earlier would have.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in `lib/planner`: that folder is the pure engine Phase 4
 * lifts into Factory Tracker, and `localStorage` is a browser API.
 *
 * Every access is wrapped: in a private window, or with site data blocked,
 * `localStorage` can be absent or throw on touch. A planner that starts empty
 * is the correct outcome there, not a crash.
