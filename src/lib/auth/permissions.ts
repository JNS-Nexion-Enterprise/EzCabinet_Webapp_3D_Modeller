/**
 * The whole access model, as one table of constants.
 *
 * Pure — no imports, no database, no React. A role's permissions are a
 * compile-time fact, not a row somebody can edit, which is what keeps every
 * gate a cheap array lookup and this file's test the specification.
 *
 * Three roles: SUPERADMIN, ADMIN, CUSTOMER. All staff do all operations,
 * so the ten permission names are kept as route annotations in Phase 6,
 * not as a UI role picker. Reinstating a divided labour is one row, not
 * an audit of every route handler.
 *
 * `catalogue:publish` is deliberately separate from `catalogue:write`:
 * publishing rewrites the live price list for every customer, so onboarding a
 * design and repointing the money are different acts.
